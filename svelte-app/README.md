Development Decisions
Svelte: Svelte was chosen for its simplicity, performance, and ease of use, making it ideal for this project.

CSS for styling: CSS was used to style the application, with media queries for responsiveness.

Local Storage: Local storage was used to persist data, ensuring that tasks are not lost on page refresh.


Future Improvements
Editing tasks: Allow users to edit existing tasks.

Filtering/Sorting: Implement options to filter tasks (e.g., show only completed tasks) and sort them by different criteria.
